# ISchedule Application

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a room/course schedule application for students and teachers, using object oriented programming principles. 

The project should cover the following functionalities:
1. intuitive user interface
2. consistency in assignments of courses to rooms
3. students can sign in for courses and view their personal schedule
4. administrators are responsible for maintenance activities  
5. administrators have control over time schedules (adjust course times, check consistency)
6. the teaching staff (administrators and assistents) can set preferences in regards to course times and rooms

The project should also cover the following conditions:
1. it is not possible to book two courses in the same room, at the same time
2. preferences of the teaching staff should be taken into account
3. course must not start before 8 a.m. and must end before 11 p.m.
4. students are not allowed to sign in for courses that are held at the same time

Personal assumptions / adjustments to requirements:
1. example data for the application is loaded internally when signing in, with example rooms, courses and profiles
2. maximum number of rooms added to the schedule is 6
3. courses can be held between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
4. preferences are limited to the course start time and the room equipment (none, standard, computers, space)
5. administrators get a warning message if a course starts at least 2 hours outside of the instructor's preference
